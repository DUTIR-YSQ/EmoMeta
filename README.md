# EmoMeta: A Chinese Multimodal Metaphor Dataset and Novel Method for Emotion Classification

We release our Dataset, a multimodal metaphorical emotion dataset in chinese consisting of 5000 pairs of text and images, with annotations indicating the presence of metaphors, target domain, source domain and emotion categories.
Our dataset is presented in the DataALL.xlsx file.

In this example, words are arranged to form a hand giving a thumbs-up, expressing appreciation for civilized behavior. Therefore, the target domain is words, the source domain is the hand, and the sentiment is trust.

## Annotation Guideline
**We provide annotators with annotation guidelines.The specific labeling steps are as follows:**

* Our annotators identify incongruent units by examining the text and visual elements, often indicating the presence of metaphors. 
* They identify these incongruent units and interpret the irreversible "A is B" identity relationship to recognize metaphorical text-image pairs.
* By determining the primary theme that a sample intends to convey, one selects one of the two entities as the target domain, with the other entity describing the target domain referred to as the source domain.
* They identify the most appropriate emotion.
  
**The classification and explanation of sentiments are as follows:**

  
* **Joy**: Joy encompasses a sense of happiness, optimism, and relaxation, embracing feelings of tranquility and ecstasy.
* **Love**: Love is a profound and positive emotional and psychological state, signifying deep and sincere affection towards individuals or entities. This sentiment has the power to evoke warm attraction, intense passion, and selfless dedication. Typically, love manifests in interpersonal relationships, such as those between family members, friends, or romantic partners.
* **Trust**: Trust involves the belief that someone or something is good, sincere, and honest. It encompasses emotions associated with acceptance, liking, and appreciation.
* **Fea**r: Fear conveys a negative sensation that arises in the face of danger or when confronted with something frightening. It encompasses emotions such as worry, anxiety, and panic, encapsulating a range of feelings including apprehension, anxiety, and terror.
* **Sadness**: Sadness is commonly employed to characterize the psychological state experienced when confronting negative emotions like loss and pain. This emotional state typically manifests as a psychological condition marked by feelings of frustration, pensiveness, or grief.
* **Disgust**: Disgust denotes a profound aversion towards someone or something deemed unacceptable, distasteful, or possessing unpleasant visual or olfactory qualities. This emotional response can encompass disinterest, dislike, or even a sense of loathing.
* **Anger**: Anger is a potent emotion that surfaces when confronted with something bad or unjust. It encompasses feelings of trouble and rage, including annoyance and intense displeasure.
